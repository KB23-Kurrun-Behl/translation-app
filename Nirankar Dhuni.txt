Nirankar Dhuni (English) Lyrics



My body and mind I devote

With your support and grace to thee

May I sing praises says Avtar

Night and day of thee

One Thou Formless, One Thou Formless

One Thou Formless O Lord

To the errors I'm prone

You are Lord of forgiveness

Don't dwell on my faults

One Thou Formless, One Thou Formless

One Thou Formless O Lord

You manifest in us all

Your benevolence shower upon us

My prayer is this O Lord

One Thou Formless, One Thou Formless

One Thou Formless O Lord

My faith in you may never falter

Love, devotion, shower dedication

May I honour all your saints

One Thou Formless, One Thou Formless

One Thou Formless O Lord
