Manglacharan (English) Lyrics



O' Almighty God, beyond attribute and formless

Thou art the creator of the universe; Thou art the sustainer of all

Thy vast entity is there in every particle of the universe

Thou were true in the past, art true at present and shall be true in future, and the world is an illusion

O' God, Thou dwelt in every being, Thou art beyond decay, and Thou art the supreme creator

Be kind and bless everybody to transcend the ocean of materialism

Thou art formless and in form, Thou art the nurturer of the universe

Endless is Thy glory, Thou art the supreme donor, the boundless

O' the Supreme Father God, all human beings are Thy own children

Be kind and benevolent to all, may all be redeemed
